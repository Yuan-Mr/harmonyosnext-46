### "Stop Struggling! HarmonyOS Official Has Already Handed You 'Performance Optimization Cheats' Hidden in Developer Alliance's [Best Practices]!"  

Brothers, while digging through documents on the HarmonyOS Developer Alliance recently, I accidentally unearthed a treasure trove‚Äî[Best Practices]. Good grief! Dozens of optimization solutions for real-world scenarios lie there, from instant switching in short-video apps to crash prevention in financial apps, with even the code packaged for you! The craziest part is that so few people know about this hardcore case library? Today, I must act as your study group leader and reveal these hidden technologies, especially the solution that makes short-video switching as smooth as Dove chocolate. After reading, you'll exclaim, "The official team is teaching you how to code"!  


### üåü In-Depth Explanation of Core Case: Short-Video Instant Switching Black Technology  
**Pain Point**: When users swipe, the new video freezes and spins? The experience collapses immediately!  
**HarmonyOS Solution (Three-Pronged Approach)**:  

1. **Dedicated Video Rendering Channel**  
   Use `XComponent` + `Surface` types to directly access GPU rendering:  
   ```typescript  
   // Create video canvas (key code)  
   XComponent({  
     id: 'video_surface',  
     type: XComponentType.SURFACE, // Invoke native rendering capabilities  
     controller: this.videoCanvas  
   })  
   .onLoad(() => {  
     const surfaceId = this.videoCanvas.getXComponentSurfaceId();  
     this.bindPlayerToSurface(surfaceId); // Bind player  
   })  
   ```  

1. **Preloading Strategy**  
   **While playing the 1st video, secretly load the 2nd and 3rd**:  
   ```typescript  
   // Swiper embedded with LazyForEach + caching strategy  
   Swiper() {  
     LazyForEach(videoList, (item) => {  
       VideoCard({ item }) // Independent component for each video  
     })  
   }  
   .cachedCount(2) // Cache 2 extra! No white screen when swiping  
   ```  

1. **Preemptive Play Before Animation Ends**  
   **As soon as the finger leaves the screen, trigger playback of the next video**:  
   ```typescript  
   Swiper()  
     .onAnimationStart((targetIndex) => {  
       // Switch data source at the start of animation  
       this.currentIndex = targetIndex;  
       videoPool[targetIndex].play(); // Play preloaded video  
     })  
     .curve(Curve.Ease) // Ditch default spring animation (40% speedup)  
     .duration(300)     // Compress animation to <300ms  
   ```  

**Effect**: Startup latency compressed to **230ms** (Huawei foldableÂÆûÊµã <200ms)  


### üí° Same Approach for These Scenarios  
The official [Best Practices] offers more "cheat-level" solutions:  

- **Financial Category**  
  - Bank wealth management pages: `Grid` + lazy loading optimizes thousands of asset cards (memory reduced by 60%)  
  - Stock K-lines: `Canvas` high-frequency drawing preventsÂç°È°ø (frame rate stable at 60fps)  

- **Content Category**  
  - News feed streams: Complex text-image mixed layout reuse strategy (smooth scrolling)  
  - Community comments: `@Reusable` component reuse (memory usage halved)  

- **Foldable-Exclusive**  
  - Hover mode: Automatic column layout switching (e.g., Mate X3 hover for video viewing)  
  - Cross-device flow: Music app playback relay (seamless continuation from phone to tablet)

### ‚ú® Why Are These Cases Game-Changers?  
1. **Backed by Real Data**: Each solution includes performance comparisons (e.g., "list rendering 45fps ‚Üí full-frame 60fps")  

1. **Direct Pitfall Prevention Guide**:  
   - Short-video cases emphasize **must-use independent SurfaceID** (shared use causes black screens!)  
   - Player instances **‰∏•Á¶ÅÂ§çÁî®** (swiping will crash‚Äîhard-learned lesson)  

1. **Copy-Paste Ready**:  
   - Building a self-developed player? Directly copy its **preloading logic** and **animation timing**  


### üöÄ Conclusion (Practical Action Guide):  
**So‚Äîare you still staying up late reinventing the wheel? HarmonyOS has already opened a 'wheel factory' at your doorstep!**  

Next time you encounter:  
- A product manager roaring, "Why is it lagging on HarmonyOS but not Android?" ‚Üí Send the **"Frame Drop Analysis Toolchain"** from [Best Practices]  
- A designer assigning a "foldable hover interaction" requirement ‚Üí Copy the **[One-Develop-Multi-Deploy Example] column code**  
- Users complaining, "Sliding videos is like a PPT" ‚Üí Unleash today's **"preloading + preemptive play" trump card**  

**Special Tip**: For cases with a **[Scenario Implementation]** chapter‚Äîfocus on them! They teach you step-by-step how to create `SurfaceID` and how many items to cache in `LazyForEach`!
